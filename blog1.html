                        Authors spend a lot of money when they write a book. They need to pay for publishers, editors, illustrators, and much more. They also spend lots of time thinking and writing a book word-by-word. But I have found I way to solve these problems. Along with CodersBee, who taught me this, I managed to write a book, along with a website, many pictures, a trailer,  and many more add-ons, all for free, and with AI.

                                Artificial Intellegence has been used to create lots of tools to write this book. Our primary tools we used were ChatGPT, Clipdrop, Blue Willow, and Fliki. Many other tools were also used briefly. Now, let’s start in the process of making this book.

                                CodersBee and I started with ChatGPT, where I learned how I can write short stories using this AI feature. Eventually, we decided on the theme of this book, a mystery and suspense novel. We had our characters with unique names, places, and a whole chapter written. 
                        <hr>
                        
                                I continued this journey to make 8 wonderful chapters I could use in this book. I came up with the ideas, and planned this book. We had to make sure the story made sense, understandable, and make sure that it doesn’t feel like AI actually wrote it. The whole writing process had been done, and reviewed by several people. But how did we create the images?

                                We used many AI tools, primarily Clipdrop, for the images. It is a great, new tool. Many of the images scattered throughout the book were used with this tool. </p>
